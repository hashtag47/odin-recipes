      <h2 class="description-heading">Description</h2>
      <p class="description">
        This clear broth seasoned with soy sauce seems very simplistic, but it
        belies the intense umami flavor within the soup. We use chicken and 4
        types of dried seafood to create an incredibly savory broth that is
        seasoned with a soy sauce tare that gives the broth a bit of sweetness
        and wonderful complexity. The best thing about this recipe is that we
        use a pressure cooker that not only helps extract all the flavor very
        quickly but also creates a beautifully clear broth.

          <h3 class="procedure">Step 1</h3>
          <p class="detail">
            Place chicken, scallops, anchovies, shrimp, bonito flakes, half the
            ginger, and kombu in an electric pressure cooker. Add water; close
            and lock the lid. Select the Soup setting; set timer for 90 minutes
            according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for
            pressure to build.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="procedure">Step 2</h3>
          <p class="detail">
            Release pressure using the natural-release method according to
            manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Strain broth through
            a colander or fine-mesh sieve. Skim the fatty oil off the top of the
            broth.
          </p>

        <li>
          <h3 class="procedure">Step 3</h3>
          <p class="detail">
            Combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, green onions, bonito flakes, sugar,
            garlic, and kombu in a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a
            boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors blend, about 10
            minutes. Strain tare sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="procedure">Step 4</h3>
          <p class="detail">
            Pour 2 tablespoons of tare sauce into a large bowl. Ladle in about 2
            cups of broth. Add 1/6 of the ramen noodles. Repeat with remaining
            tare, broth, and ramen.
